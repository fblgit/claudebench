### By Domain
| Domain | Test Files | Total Tests | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Task | 4 | ~32 | All failing |
| Hook | 3 | 27 | All failing |
| System | 4 | 34 | All failing |
| Integration | 5 | ~25+ | All failing |

## Key Observations

1. **All tests are currently failing** - This aligns with TDD approach where tests are written first
2. **Test duplication in log** - Each test appears twice, likely from parallel test execution
3. **Fast execution times** - Most tests execute in <1ms, some taking up to 9.70ms
4. **Missing test output** - The log was truncated, missing some test cases from:
   - task.create.test.ts
   - multi-instance.test.ts
   - hook-validation.test.ts
   - task-queue.test.ts
   - todowrite.test.ts

## Next Steps

According to the specs, these tests should start passing as handlers are implemented:
1. Core infrastructure (T024-T029) is marked complete but tests still failing
2. Handlers (T034-T046) are marked complete but corresponding tests failing
3. Need to investigate why implemented components aren't making tests pass

## Test Execution Performance

- **Fastest test**: 0.07ms (task.complete - reject invalid input)
- **Slowest test**: 9.70ms (system.get_state - cache state snapshots)
- **Average execution**: ~1ms per test
- **Total visible tests**: 94 failing
