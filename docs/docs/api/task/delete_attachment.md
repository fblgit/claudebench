# task.delete_attachment

### Example Request (Delete Git Attachment)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "task.delete_attachment",

    "taskId": "t-1234567890",
    "key": "git-commit-abc123d"
  },

}
```

## Response

### Success Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "id": "ta-1758272800000-x8k2n9qp3",
    "taskId": "t-1234567890",
    "key": "analysis",
    "deleted": true,
    "deletedAt": "2025-01-19T11:00:00Z"
  },
  "id": "req-012"
}
```

### Error Response (Attachment Not Found)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Attachment 'analysis' not found for task t-1234567890",
    "data": {
      "taskId": "t-1234567890",
      "key": "analysis"
    }
  },
  "id": "req-012"
}
```

## Event Emission

When an attachment is successfully deleted, an event is published:

```json
{
  "type": "task.attachment.deleted",
  "payload": {
    "taskId": "t-1234567890",
    "key": "analysis",
    "attachmentId": "ta-1758272800000-x8k2n9qp3"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "deletedBy": "instance-1",
    "deletedAt": "2025-01-19T11:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### Clean Up Outdated Attachments
Remove attachments that are no longer relevant or have been superseded:
- Old analysis results
- Deprecated documentation
- Obsolete configuration

### Remove Sensitive Data
Delete attachments containing sensitive information:
- API keys accidentally attached
- Personal data that should be removed
- Temporary debugging information

### Manage Storage
Free up storage by removing large attachments:
- Old git commit diffs
- Extensive log files
- Redundant documentation

### Workflow Cleanup
Remove temporary attachments used during task processing:
- Intermediate computation results
- Temporary configuration overrides
- Debug attachments

## Notes

### Prerequisites
- Task must exist in the system
- Attachment with specified key must exist for the task
- User must have permission to modify the task

### Warnings
- **This action cannot be undone** - deleted attachments are permanently removed
- Attachment will be removed from both Redis and PostgreSQL
- If PostgreSQL deletion fails, the operation continues (Redis deletion succeeds)
- Related references in other tasks are not automatically updated

### Storage Behavior
- Immediately removes from Redis hash (`cb:task:{taskId}:attachment:{key}`)
- Removes from Redis index (`cb:task:{taskId}:attachments`)
- Attempts deletion from PostgreSQL `task_attachments` table
- Graceful handling if PostgreSQL deletion fails (logs warning)

### Error Handling
- Returns error if attachment key doesn't exist
- Returns error if task doesn't exist
- Continues operation if PostgreSQL deletion fails (Redis deletion succeeds)
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures

### Performance
- O(1) complexity for Redis operations
- Rate limited to 100 deletions per minute
- 5 second timeout for operation
- Circuit breaker threshold of 10 failures
