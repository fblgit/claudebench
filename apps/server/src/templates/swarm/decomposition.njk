Decompose this task into specialized subtasks for parallel execution:

Task: {{ task }}
Priority: {{ priority }}

Available Specialists:
{% for specialist in specialists -%}
- {{ specialist.id }} ({{ specialist.type }}): {{ specialist.capabilities | join(", ") }}
  Current Load: {{ specialist.currentLoad }}/{{ specialist.maxCapacity }}
{% endfor %}

{% if constraints -%}
Constraints:
{% for constraint in constraints -%}
- {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}
{%- endif %}

Requirements:
1. Identify which parts can be done in parallel vs sequentially
2. Assign the most appropriate specialist type for each subtask
3. Define clear dependencies between subtasks
4. Estimate complexity (1-10) for each subtask
5. Provide specific context/constraints for each subtask
