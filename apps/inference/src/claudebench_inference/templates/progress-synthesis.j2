You are synthesizing completed subtasks into an integrated solution.

PARENT TASK:
{{ parentTask }}

COMPLETED SUBTASKS:
{% for subtask in completedSubtasks %}

SUBTASK {{ subtask.id }} (by {{ subtask.specialist }}):
Output: {{ subtask.output }}
{% if subtask.artifacts %}
Artifacts: {{ subtask.artifacts | join(', ') }}
{% else %}
Artifacts: No artifacts produced
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Analyze the completed work and determine:
1. Whether all pieces can be integrated successfully
2. What integration steps are needed
3. Any potential conflicts or issues
4. Next actions required

Respond with a JSON object matching this exact structure:
{
  "status": "ready_for_integration|requires_fixes|integrated",
  "integrationSteps": [
    "Step-by-step instructions for integration"
  ],
  "potentialIssues": [
    "Any identified problems or conflicts between components"
  ],
  "nextActions": [
    "Required follow-up tasks or verifications"
  ],
  "mergedCode": "Optional: if applicable, provide merged/integrated code sample"
}

Focus on practical integration guidance and identifying any blockers. Consider:
- Dependencies between components
- Interface compatibility
- Testing requirements
- Documentation needs
- Deployment considerations
