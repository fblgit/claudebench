You are generating execution context for a {{ specialist }} specialist.

SUBTASK DETAILS:
ID: {{ subtaskId }}
Description: {{ description }}
{% if dependencies %}
Dependencies: {{ dependencies | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}

{% if constraints %}
CONSTRAINTS:
{% for constraint in constraints %}
  - {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Generate comprehensive execution context to help the specialist succeed. Consider:
1. What specific knowledge or documentation they need
2. Architectural constraints they must follow
3. Related work from other specialists they should be aware of
4. Clear success criteria

You MUST respond ONLY with a valid JSON object, no other text. The JSON must match this exact structure:
{
  "taskId": "{{ subtaskId }}",
  "description": "Expanded description with full context",
  "scope": "Clear definition of what's in scope and what's out of scope",
  "mandatoryReadings": [
    {"title": "Document or resource title", "path": "/path/to/resource"}
  ],
  "architectureConstraints": [
    "List of architectural requirements and constraints"
  ],
  "relatedWork": [
    {"instanceId": "worker-id", "status": "completed|in_progress", "summary": "What they're working on"}
  ],
  "successCriteria": [
    "Measurable criteria for successful completion"
  ]
}

Be specific and actionable. Focus on practical guidance that helps the {{ specialist }} specialist complete their task efficiently.
