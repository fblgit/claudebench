You are resolving a conflict between different implementation approaches.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Type: {{ projectType }}

REQUIREMENTS:
{% for requirement in requirements %}
  - {{ requirement }}
{% endfor %}

{% if constraints %}
CONSTRAINTS:
{% for constraint in constraints %}
  - {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

COMPETING SOLUTIONS:
{% for solution in solutions %}

SOLUTION {{ loop.index }} (from {{ solution.instanceId }}):
Approach: {{ solution.approach }}
Reasoning: {{ solution.reasoning }}
{% if solution.code %}
Code Sample:
```
{{ solution.code[:500] }}{% if solution.code|length > 500 %}...{% endif %}
```
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Analyze these solutions and choose the best one based on:
1. Alignment with project requirements
2. Technical merit and best practices
3. Maintainability and scalability
4. Performance implications
5. Team capabilities

Respond with a JSON object matching this exact structure:
{
  "chosenSolution": "Clear description of the chosen approach",
  "instanceId": "ID of the specialist whose solution was chosen",
  "justification": "Detailed reasoning for why this solution is best",
  "recommendations": [
    "Specific improvements or modifications to the chosen solution"
  ],
  "modifications": [
    "Optional: specific changes needed before implementation"
  ]
}

Be objective and provide clear technical justification for your decision. Consider trade-offs and explain why the chosen solution best balances all requirements.
