## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using Claude Code on localhost, I want a simple event-driven orchestration system that lets me customize how my AI coding sessions work by defining custom event handlers, hooks, and workflows through a lightweight Redis-based architecture, so that I can tailor my development experience and automate repetitive tasks without enterprise complexity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Claude Code session is running, **When** I use the TodoWrite tool to create tasks, **Then** ClaudeBench captures the todo events and persists them for processing
2. **Given** multiple tasks are queued in the system, **When** a worker instance is available, **Then** the task is automatically assigned and processed
3. **Given** a tool execution is requested, **When** the pre-tool hook is configured, **Then** the system validates the operation before allowing execution
4. **Given** an event is published to the system, **When** subscribers are registered, **Then** all subscribers receive the event in real-time
5. **Given** a circuit breaker threshold is reached, **When** new requests arrive, **Then** the system blocks requests until the circuit recovers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Redis connection is lost? System exits gracefully (Redis is the heartbeat - we die together)
- How does system handle concurrent task assignments to prevent duplication?
- What happens when a worker instance crashes mid-task? Best-effort recovery via state retrieval (system.get_state) and TodoWrite context
- How does the system handle event ordering and consistency?
- What are the rate limits for event processing? Default 100 events/second as loop prevention guardrail

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide event-driven communication using a publish-subscribe pattern
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow registration of event handlers with input/output validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose handlers through multiple transport methods simultaneously (HTTP endpoints, MCP tools, event subscriptions)
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture and process TodoWrite events from Claude Code sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST manage task queues with assignment and completion tracking
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide hook mechanisms for pre and post tool execution validation
- **FR-007**: System MUST support instance registration with role-based capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide simple loop prevention rate limiting (default 100/second, configurable per handler)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain instance health through heartbeat monitoring (30 second timeout)
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow explicit data persistence decisions per handler
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow transport-specific session management (HTTP/MCP handle their own sessions, event bus is stateless)
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate all inputs and outputs using defined schemas
- **FR-014**: System MUST emit notifications when handler lists change
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle JSONRPC 2.0 protocol for all communication (presence of 'id' field determines request vs notification)
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide state retrieval mechanism for best-effort recovery (system.get_state)
- **FR-017**: System MUST support typical localhost development patterns (1 event per 3 seconds normal, burst up to 3 events in 10 seconds)
- **FR-018**: System MUST allow custom event workflows (e.g., "when TodoWrite updates from non-master role, broadcast to master")
- **FR-019**: System MUST pass session/auth data through optional metadata fields that handlers can check gracefully
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide Docker Compose configuration for Redis and PostgreSQL setup
- **FR-021**: System MUST enforce domain.action event naming pattern (e.g., task.create, hook.pre_tool)
- **FR-022**: System MUST use consistent Redis key pattern cb:{type}:{id} for all Redis operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Represents an action or notification in the system with type, payload, and metadata
- **Task**: A unit of work with status, priority, assignment, and completion tracking
- **Instance**: A registered worker or service with roles, health status, and capabilities
- **Handler**: A processor for specific event types with validation and business logic
- **Hook**: An interception point for tool execution with validation and transformation capabilities
- **Session**: Optional metadata (sessionId, tokens) passed in JSONRPC messages - handlers check metadata gracefully if needed

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Redis** (via Docker Compose) - Event bus, queuing, state management
- **PostgreSQL** (via Docker Compose) - Persistent storage for handlers that need it
- **Prisma ORM** - Database access layer
- **Zod** - Runtime schema validation for all inputs/outputs
- **MCP SDK** (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) - MCP server implementation for Claude Code integration
- **Existing Stack** - Built on top of current boilerplate: Bun runtime, Hono server, React frontend, TanStack Router, Turborepo

### Assumptions
- **Single developer usage** - Localhost development tool, not multi-user system
- **Low throughput environment** - ~1 event per 3 seconds typical, burst up to 3/10s
- **Redis reliability** - Redis runs locally via Docker, no failover needed (we die together)
- **Trust model** - No auth needed for localhost single-user scenario
- **Best-effort recovery** - System provides state retrieval but doesn't guarantee zero data loss
- **Developer knowledge** - Users can write event handlers and understand event patterns
- **Decorator pattern familiarity** - Developers understand how decorators auto-generate multiple interfaces
- **Claude Code availability** - Assumes Claude Code with hook system is available
- **Docker environment** - User has Docker running for Redis and PostgreSQL
