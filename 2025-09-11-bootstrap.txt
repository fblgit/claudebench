> hi there!

⏺ Hello! I'm ready to help you with your ClaudeBench project. I can see this is a TypeScript monorepo with a Redis-first event-driven architecture that's transitioning
   from enterprise patterns to a more streamlined 500 LOC design.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  • Your project aims to reduce from 5000+ LOC to 500 LOC using Redis as infrastructure
  • The architecture uses a decorator pattern where single handlers auto-generate HTTP, MCP, and event interfaces
  • The system follows JSONRPC 2.0 protocol with optional PostgreSQL persistence
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  What would you like to work on today? I can help with:
  - Implementing the Redis-based event handlers
  - Setting up the decorator pattern for auto-generating interfaces
  - Working on the backend (Hono) or frontend (React + TanStack Router)
  - Database operations with Prisma
  - Or any other aspect of the codebase

  Just let me know what you need!

> @README.md
  ⎿  Read README.md (90 lines)

⏺ I'll read the crucial documents mentioned in the README to understand the ClaudeBench architecture and specifications properly.

⏺ Now let me read these important documents to properly understand the ClaudeBench system:

⏺ Read(CLAUDEBENCH.md)
  ⎿  Read 565 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(specs/001-claudebench/spec.md)
  ⎿  Read 166 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I'll continue reading the remaining critical documents to get a complete understanding of the ClaudeBench system:

⏺ Read(specs/001-claudebench/CONTRACT-DRIVEN-DEVELOPMENT.md)
  ⎿  Read 200 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me continue reading this important document and the remaining critical files:

⏺ Read(specs/001-claudebench/data-model.md)
  ⎿  Read 269 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(specs/001-claudebench/quickstart.md)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've now read all the critical documents. Let me complete my todo list:

⏺ Excellent! I've now loaded all the critical documents about ClaudeBench. Here's what I understand about your project:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  • ClaudeBench is evolving from 5000+ LOC enterprise patterns to a 500 LOC Redis-first architecture using a decorator pattern where single handlers auto-generate
  HTTP, MCP, and event interfaces
  • The system follows strict contract-driven development with JSONRPC 2.0 protocol, Zod validation, and explicit persistence decisions
  • Redis serves as the central nervous system for events, queues, and state, while PostgreSQL is used only when handlers explicitly choose persistence
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Current Project Status

  Based on the git status, you have some modified files in CLAUDE.md and README.md on branch 001-claudebench. The recent commits show you've been working on:
  - Contract tests alignment and fixes
  - Type checking improvements
  - All contracts tests passing and aligned

  ClaudeBench Architecture Summary

  The system is a Redis-first event-driven orchestration tool for Claude Code that:
  - Uses a single @EventHandler decorator to generate multiple transport interfaces (HTTP, MCP, WebSocket)
  - Implements the domain.action event naming pattern (e.g., task.create, hook.pre_tool)
  - Stores hot data in Redis with pattern cb:{type}:{id}
  - Allows explicit persistence to PostgreSQL when needed
  - Validates everything with Zod schemas aligned to JSONRPC contracts

  The target is 500 LOC total:
  - Core infrastructure: 150 LOC
  - Business handlers: 300 LOC
  - Validation schemas: 50 LOC

  What would you like to work on? I can help with:
  - Implementing specific event handlers following the contract-driven approach
  - Setting up the Redis infrastructure and event bus
  - Creating the decorator pattern system
  - Writing contract tests for handlers
  - Or any other aspect of the ClaudeBench implementation
